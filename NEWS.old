Versions 1.0 to 4.0 (various authors, copied from upstream source)
==================================================================


mw = Markus Werner mw+nagios@wobcom.de
Remarks (mw):

	I adopted as much as possible the programming style of the origin code.

	There should be a function to exit this programm,
	instead of calling print and exit statements all over the place.


minor changes by mw
	The snmp if_counters on net devices can have overflows.
	I wrote this code to address this situation.
	It has no automatic detection and which point the overflow
	occurs but it will generate a warning state and you
	can set the max value by calling this script with an additional
	arg.

minor cosmetic changes by mw
	Sorry but I couldn't sustain to clean up some things.

gj = Greg Frater gregATfraterfactory.com
Remarks (gj):
minor (gj):

	* fixed the performance data, formating was not to spec
	* Added a check of the interfaces status (up/down).
	  If down the check returns a critical status.
	* Allow either textual or the numeric index value.
	* If the interface speed is not specified on the command line
	  it gets it automatically from IfSpeed
	* Added option for second ifSpeed to allow for asymetrcal links
	  such as a DSL line or cable modem where the download and upload
	  speeds are different
	* Added -B option to display results in bits/sec instead of Bytes/sec
	* Added the current usage in Bytes/s (or bit/s) to the perfdata output
	* Added ability for plugin to determine interface to query by matching IP
	  address of host with entry in ipAdEntIfIndex (.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.20.1.2)
	* Added -L flag to list entries found in the ipAdEntIfIndex table
	Otherwise, it works as before.


Ektanoor
	Had to radically change several snippets of code to make calculations more consistent
	Internally all is calculated on bits. This is the basic unit for traffic calculation, so it shall stay as such.
	No internal calculations for dimensions. All megas, gigas and kilos are made only at the beginning and ending.
	Had to turn SNMP to version 2 as we need 64-bit counters. The 32-bit overflow too fast and too frequently.
	Changed the way to calculate overflow. The new one is more rational and solid.
	All errors go to stop().
	Final note: The new version works but it can be made a lot better. All I have done was to make it workable with fast speed interfaces.

      4.1 - Several changes, most of them to fit better an ISP environment:
      - bits per second are the default now. Use -B for bytes.
      - RX, TX and absolute values show bytes/octets only.
      - We now use Perl's given-where "switch" in some places. Look for the correct "use" for your version of perl.
